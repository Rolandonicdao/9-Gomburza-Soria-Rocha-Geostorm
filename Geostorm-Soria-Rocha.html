<b><h4> Our Top 5 Favorite Scenes:</h4></b>

<b><h5> The disasters scene</b></h5>

<img src="Screenshot_20241203-065835.jpg" width="200" height="150">

<p>We all know that this movie is about global level disasters. So in the following scenes it shows all the Disasters happen in different parts of the world. For example: In Hong Kong  there was a massive Underground volcano eruption that turned into a Fiery Tornado of some sort that formed in the city and a MASSIVE Tsunami that swallowed the city in dubai and some other disasters somewhere else. We loved this part since it showed all the disasters which is pretty wild.</p>

<b><h5>The space laser that hit Moscow </b></h5>

<img src="Screenshot_20241203-065839.jpg" width="200" height="150">

<p>So all the disasters are just kind off normal disasters but just WAYYY Bigger, Well except this one. So when we first saw this scene we were just kind of weirded out. I mean it’s a big laser from the sky that just hit Russia and it did DAMAGE. It came from the satellite which made it less weird because never saw one before.</p>

<b><h5> Last stand</b></h5>

<img src="Screenshot_20241203-065844.jpg" width="200" height ="150">

<p>This is the part where the crew is in the satellite and is trying to de-activate the virus that malfunctioned the satellite. This is pretty intense since they have a time limit because disasters keep appearing on earth which will kill everyone. After learning that they can’t de-activate the satellite, the crew evacuates while Jake and ute stayed to Reboot the system. They then escape in a ship and the satellite self destructs which eliminated the virus and they escaped.<p>

<b><h5> Lightning Storm</b></h5>

<p>Okay this scene is also very intense aswell. So basically there was a campaign going on with the president. As far as we remember they kidnapped the president because he was gonna get killed by the agents and the president also has the kill code for the Satellite which makes him a very important person in the movie. This was intense because they were being  chased by the agents while evading a Lightning storm WHICH destroyed the arena where the president was at earlier. Overall a chase scene while avoiding Bullets and Lightings.</p>

<b><h5> Jake becomes the Head Engineer</b></h5>

<img src="Screenshot_20241203-065852.jpg" width="200" height="150">

<p>So Jake was one of the 2 People that rebooted the system of the satellite. Saving all the people on earth and preventing the geostorm. After all of those sacrifices and hardwork, a few months later after the events of the satellite, Jake becomes the head engineer for a new system of satellites which is Kinda Ironic since he saved us from the satellite now he works on one. Still a very great ending and we loved it.</p>
